However, if you have the Upwork Profile, go to the Find Work> Find Jobs. It will open up a search page on Upwork. To create the RSS feed for “Google Tag Manager”, Type the keyword “Google Tag Manager” in the search field, and hit the search icon. Once the search results have been updated, add a filter of “Payment Verified” from the left “Filters By” tab. Selecting the filter “Payment Verified” will update the Upwork Search Page again. Now click on the RSS icon, and click “RSS”.
