<YoutubeEmbed embedId={metadata.embedId} />

Google Tag Manager allows us to manage and deploy marketing tags on our website without modifying the code. This is especially useful for those of us who aren‚Äôt developers.

Don't worry; we're keeping things simple and straightforward.

### Prerequisites:

- A Google Account (assuming everyone has one).
- A Shopify store.

If you're all set, let's dive in!

## Setting Up Your GTM Account

For those who already have a GTM account:

1. [Log in to your account](https://tagmanager.google.com). You will see your existing containers. But if you're new, you won't see any.
2. Click on **Create Account** on the top right.
3. Enter the name of your company or business.
4. Under the container, set up the URL of your website.

<Note

 domains for the same business, use one container."

## Integrating GTM on Shopify

Now, we need to place the GTM code snippets on your Shopify store. Don't worry; it's just copying and pasting.

1. Head to Google Tag Manager. You'll find two snippets:

<div className="pl-4">

- One for the **head** section of your site.
- One for the **body** section.

</div>

2. Copy the **head** snippet.
3. Go to your Shopify dashboard > **Online Store** > **Themes** > Click the three dots (‚Ä¶) > **Edit Code**.
4. Navigate to the **theme** section, and right under the `<head>`, paste the code you copied.
5. Now, go back to GTM and copy the **body** snippet.
6. In Shopify's code editor, find the `<body>` tag. You can use Ctrl + F or Command + F to search.
7. Paste the **body** code snippet right after the opening `<body>` tag.

<Note
