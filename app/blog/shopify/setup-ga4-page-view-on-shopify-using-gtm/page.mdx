## Installing the Google Tag Manager (GTM) Container on Shopify

1. Log in to your GTM account.
2. Navigate to the **Admin** section and select **Container Settings**.
3. Under the install section, you'll find two tracking snippets. One is for the `<head>` and the other is for the `<body>` section of your site.
4. Copy the tracking code for the `<head>`.
5. On your Shopify dashboard, navigate to **Online Store** > **Themes**.
6. Click on **Edit Code** and locate the `theme.liquid` file.
7. Find the `<head>` tag and paste the GTM tracking code you copied.
8. Return to GTM and grab the tracking code for the `<body>`.
9. Back in the `theme.liquid` file, search for the `<body>` tag and paste the second tracking code.
10. Optionally, format the liquid to ensure it's readable.
11. Save your changes.

## Verifying GTM Installation

1. Visit your Shopify store.
2. Use the **Google Tag Assistant** extension to check if GTM is correctly implemented. It should indicate that a GTM container has been found on the website.

## Integrating Google Analytics 4 (GA4)

1. In your GA4 account, click on **Admin** located at the bottom left.
2. Go to **Property Settings** > **Data Streams**.
3. Locate the relevant data stream (e.g., Web) and copy the **Measurement ID**.
4. Return to your GTM workspace.
5. Navigate to **Variables** and create a constant variable named "GA4 Measurement ID" with the copied ID.
6. Now, go to **Tags** > **New**.
7. Choose a suitable name and select **GTag** as the tag type.
8. Insert your "GA4 Measurement ID" variable.
9. Save your changes and preview the workspace to ensure everything is functioning correctly.
10. If all goes well, GA4 should now be capturing data from your Shopify store!
