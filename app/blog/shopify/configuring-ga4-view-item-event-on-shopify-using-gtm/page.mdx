### Introduction

In this blog, we will walk you through the process of configuring the 'view_item' event for GA4 using Google Tag Manager, so you can track user visits to your product pages, the items they view, and various event details. This will be achieved using Google Tag Manager with a Shopify store and Google Analytics 4.

<YoutubeEmbed embedId={metadata.embedId} />

### Pre-requisites

Before we dive in, ensure you have the following:

1. Google Tag Manager container set up on your Shopify store.
2. An active Shopify account.
3. A Google Analytics 4 property created.

### Configuring Google Analytics 4 with Google Tag Manager

#### **Connect GA4 Property to GTM**:

- Go to your Google Analytics property.
- On the bottom left corner, select "Admin".
- Under the property column, navigate to "Data Streams".
- Data stream acts as a connection between your Shopify store and Google Analytics property.
- If you haven't set up a web stream, do so now. Otherwise, find your "Measurement ID".

<Note

/>

#### **Set up Variables in Google Tag Manager**:

- Go to Google Tag Manager.
- Create a user-defined constant variable.
- Paste the copied Measurement ID and rename it to "G4 Measurement ID".

#### **Creating the GA4 Configuration Tag**:

- In Google Tag Manager, navigate to the tags section.
- Create a new tag that will track common events such as page views, user engagement, and session starts.
- Previously, we had the G4 configuration tag, but now it's replaced by Google tag. Use your G4 Measurement ID as the tag ID.
- Rename the tag for clarity, for example, "gtag G4 configuration tag".

### Setting up the View Item Trigger

1. In Google Tag Manager, navigate to the triggers section.
2. Create a custom event named "custom view item" (to avoid potential issues with other integrations or apps).
3. Next, create a tag in GTM to send this view item event to GA4. Make sure the event name is the standard "view item".
4. To test the integration, use the GTM preview mode and visit one of your product pages. Ensure the "view item" event is triggering correctly.

### Shopify Store Configuration for the Event

To successfully trigger the "view item" event, the Shopify store must also be configured. This requires some coding:

1. Go to your Shopify store backend.
2. Navigate to the online store and themes section.
3. Before making any changes, create a duplicate of your theme for backup purposes.
4. Add the necessary JavaScript code for the event, from the next section.
5. The code snippet will trigger the view item event. However, to execute this on your website, you must include the snippet in your main theme file.
6. Once done, refresh your product page and validate that the custom event triggers correctly.

Certainly! Let's break down the code snippets and provide a detailed explanation along with steps on how to add these snippets to a Shopify store.

## DataLayer Code Snippets Overview

The provided code snippets aim to integrate the `dataLayer` object for Google Tag Manager (GTM) with a Shopify store. The main goal is to send an event called `custom_view_item` whenever a user visits a product page on Shopify. This event can then be used in GTM to trigger the `view_item` event for Google Analytics 4 (GA4).

### Head DataLayer Code

This code initializes the `dataLayer` array if it hasn't been already. It then checks if the current page template is a 'product' page and renders a specific snippet called 'datalayer-product'.

```jsx
<script>
    window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
</script>

{%- if template contains 'product' -%}
  {%- render 'datalayer-product', product: product -%}
{%- endif -%}
```

### Product DataLayer Code

This code snippet contains the main logic for populating the `dataLayer` object with product details whenever a product page is viewed:

1. It first captures the current variant of the product.
2. It constructs an `itemObject` containing various product details.
3. On document load, it pushes this data to the `dataLayer` object.

```jsx
{%- liquid assign current_variant = product.selected_or_first_available_variant -%}

<script>
  console.log("datalayer-product snippet is loaded")
  var itemObject = {
      item_id: {{ current_variant.id | json }},
      id: {{ current_variant.id | json }},
      item_name: {{ product.title | json }},
      currency: {{ shop.currency | json }},
      item_brand: {{ product.vendor | json }},
      item_category: {{ product.type | json }},
      item_variant: {{ current_variant.title | json }},
      price: {{ current_variant.price }} / 100,
      google_business_vertical: 'retail',
      quantity: 1
  }

  document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
      dataLayer.push({ ecommerce: null });  // Clear the previous ecommerce object.
      dataLayer.push({
          event: "custom_view_item",
          ecommerce: {
          currency: {{ shop.currency | json }},
              items: [itemObject]
          }
      });
  })
</script>
```

### Theme DataLayer Code

This code renders the `head-datalayer` snippet. Depending on the setup of your Shopify theme, this is likely where the head datalayer code resides. Add this code GTM Body Code.

```jsx
{% render 'head-datalayer' %}
```

## Steps to Add the DataLayer Code Snippets in Shopify:

1. **Backup**: Before making any changes, always backup your current theme.

2. **Access Theme Files**:

   - Login to your Shopify Admin.
   - Go to Online Store > Themes.
   - Click on the "Actions" dropdown for your live theme and select "Edit code".

3. **Add Head DataLayer Code**:

   - In the left sidebar, locate and click on `theme.liquid`.
   - Insert the "Head DataLayer Code" snippet within the `<head>` tags.

4. **Add Product DataLayer Code**:

   - Click "Add a new template" or "Add a new snippet" depending on your Shopify version.
   - Name it `datalayer-product.liquid`.
   - Insert the "Product DataLayer Code" snippet into this new file.
   - Save changes.

5. **Add Theme DataLayer Code**:

   - Determine where you want this code to render (usually within the `<head>` tags in `theme.liquid`).
   - Insert the "Theme DataLayer Code" snippet in the desired location.
   - Save changes.

6. **Test**:
   - Visit a product page on your Shopify store.
   - Open browser's developer console.
   - Confirm that the `custom_view_item` event is fired and the `dataLayer` object contains the correct product details.

Remember, these instructions assume a typical Shopify setup. Some custom themes might require a different approach. Always test thoroughly before and after making changes.

### Integrating Enhanced E-commerce Parameters with GTM

Although the basic "view item" event is now configured, to get detailed e-commerce metrics such as item id or item name, further integration is needed.

1. In GTM, under variables, create a new setting variable.
2. Use the Google tag event settings and add an event parameter for items.
3. Create a data layer variable to fetch the items array.
4. Save and rename it for clarity.

<Note

## Conclusion

Configuring the "view item" event using Google Tag Manager, Shopify, and Google Analytics 4 can provide detailed insights into user behavior on your product pages. By following this tutorial step-by-step, you can effectively set up and track this crucial e-commerce event.
